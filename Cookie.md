# Cookie
Cookie can be created by global cookie helper of Laravel. It is an instance of Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Cookie. The cookie can be attached to the response using the withCookie() method. Create a response instance of Illuminate\Http\Response class to call the withCookie() method. Cookie generated by the Laravel are encrypted and signed and it canâ€™t be modified or read by the client.

Here is a sample code with explanation.
```
//Create a response instance
$response = new Illuminate\Http\Response('Hello World');

//Call the withCookie() method with the response method
$response->withCookie(cookie('name', 'value', $minutes));

//return the response
return $response;
```

  public function setCookie(Request $req) {
        $res = new Response('Hello Coder !');
        $res->withCookie(cookie('name','Nitish Kumar',10));
        return $res;
    }
```

```
public function getCookie(Request $req) {
        echo $req->cookie('name');
    }
```
